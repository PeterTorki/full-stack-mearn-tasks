Step 1: Is it an Arrow Function?
âœ… Arrow functions do not have their own this.
They inherit this from the surrounding scope (lexical context)

Step 2: Is it called as a Method on an Object?
âœ… If a regular function is called like object.method(), then:
this = the object before the dot

Step 3: Is it a Regular Function Call (not a method)?
âœ… If the function is called normally (e.g., myFunc()), then:

- In strict mode: this = undefined
- In non-strict mode (browser): this = window

âœ… BONUS Steps (when needed):
ðŸ”¸ Was it called using .call(), .apply(), or .bind()?
You manually set this.

ðŸ”¸ Is it inside a Class?

- Inside a method â†’ this = instance
- Inside arrow function â†’ this = outer context (often still the instance)
